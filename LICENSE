I am opening this project to the public under the assumption that there is nothing illegal or against school policy in this project. 
If you feel that you could improve this project or would just like to experiment feel free to submit a pull request.
Do whatever you want with the code. Just be smart about it and don't do anything illegal or against school policy.
If you would like to contact me just email me at mfeigenbaum23@gmail.com.
